# End of Life 
This project has reached EOL status. It will no longer be updated, patched, or supported. If you are interested in continuing the work, feel free to do so and republish the app anywhere, with respect to the license. Not sure why you would do that though, as this codebase is somewhat of a time machine and as such, in huge technical debt. It also doesn't integrate the new WaniKani API (v2).

Thank you all for the support throughout the life of this effort.
